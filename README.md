# GossipAlgorithm
This project aims to study the convergence of two key algorithms, Gossip and Push-Sum, used in
distributed systems for information propagation and sum computation, respectively. The
algorithms are executed using asynchronous actors in Pony, with a focus on measuring their
performance across different network topologies and varying numbers of nodes.<br>
The goal of the project is to determine how long it takes for the algorithms to converge across
different topologies and network sizes, which can significantly affect the speed of information
dissemination or computation.<br>
The main objectives include:<br>
1. Implementing the Gossip and Push-Sum algorithms using Pony's actor model.<br>
2. Experimenting with various topologies such as Full Network, 3D Grid, Line, and Imperfect
3D Grid.<br>
3. Measuring convergence times across different network sizes for both algorithms.<br>
4. Analyzing the results and drawing conclusions based on the experimental data.<br>
